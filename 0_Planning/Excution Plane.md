# üõí Retail Sales Case Study ‚Äì Execution Plan

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Preparation
**Stakeholder Need:**  
‚ÄúClean and organize the dataset. Fix missing values, incorrect types, and make sure we can analyze by year and month.‚Äù

 

##  Execution Plan  

1. **Load Data**  
   - Import dataset into Python using **Pandas**.  
   - Store a copy of the raw dataset for reference.  

2. **Handle Missing & Invalid Data**  
   - Check for missing values across all columns.  
   - Decide per column whether to **impute**, **replace**, or **remove** records.  
   - Fix incorrect product categories (typos, inconsistent labels).  
   - Replace missing customer names with `"Unknown"`.  

3. **Detect & Handle Outliers**  
   - Use **IQR (Interquartile Range)** or **Z-score** method to detect outliers in:  
     - `Sales`  
     - `Profit`  
     - `Discount`  
   - Decide whether to cap, transform, or flag them.  

4. **Fix Data Types**  
   - Convert `Order Date` and `Ship Date` to `datetime`.  
   - Ensure `Sales`, `Profit`, `Discount`, and `Quantity` are numeric.  
   - Standardize categorical columns (`Region`, `Category`, `Payment Method`, etc.).  

5. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Extract **Year** and **Month** from `Order Date`.  
   - Create **Profit Margin** = `Profit / Sales`.  
   - Recalculate `Total Sales` = `Quantity * Unit Price * (1 - Discount)`.  

6. **Validation**  
   - Confirm there are no duplicates.  
   - Check that cleaned data can be grouped and aggregated reliably.  
   - Ensure output dataset is consistent across **Excel**, **Python**, and **SQL** versions.
